***** Background:
This data is similar to the SORCE SOLSTICE instrument measurements (though it is a small subset of the
wavelength range). The SORCE mission ended in February 2020 after 17 years of on-orbit operations.
The SORCE mission measured Solar Irradiance variability over almost 2 complete 11-years Solar cycle.

The SOLSTICE instrument measured the daily Solar Irradiance spectra (Watts/nm/m^2) in the ultra-violet (from 115nm to 300nm). 
Light entered the aperture, followed the optical path, was dispersed by a grating, then landed on a photomultiplier 
tube (PMT) detector which counted the number of photon events detected per integration time (count rate). 
As the grating rotated, the wavelength of light hitting the pmt changed, allowing for the photon counts as a function
of wavelength. 

The SORCE spacecraft was in an orbit with roughly a ninety minute period in Lower Earth Orbit (LEO). Later in the mission,
the instrument saw larger than designed temperature swing within each orbit. As the PMT's efficiency in detecting photons 
changes with temperature, a temperature correction needs to be applied.

Also, during that time period,the grating position was reset with each orbit and never returned to the exact fiducial. 
This created a small grating offset from orbit to orbit, from what was actually reported, resulting in a wavelength shift.
The provided reference spectra (with well known wavelength and expected irradiances) could be used to align each dataset.

The SOLSTICE instrument ran various experiments on a daily basis throughout the mission. The included data 
covers about five orbits, with different experiments on each orbit. The various grating scans in this dataset correspond to
actual Solar measurements around the Silicon-2 emission lines (~180nm). All the data provided is time-tagged and  subset of
the activities are defined in the file plans.txt


Over this time period, it is reasonable to assume that there were no measurable solar variability for this wavelength range.

**********************************************************************************************************************
***** Task:
Please calculate the irradiance in watts/nm/m^2 for the UpScan and DownScan and compare the results. 
Provide plots of your results along with your code. 
Specifically, plot the Irradiance as a function of Wavelength around the two emission lines at ~180nm [180 to 183nm]. 
Also, calculate and plot the ratio of the Irradiances at each wavelength for each scan with respect to the reference spectrum. i

What are your thoughts? Use any language you are comfortable with.

Submit your code, plots and discussion about your process, results and how they compare to the reference spectra.

***** Equations

The microsecondsSinceGpsEpoch column is the default time stamp for the telemetry coming from the
spacecraft and corresponds to the number of  micro-seconds since 1980-01-06 00:00:00.000.

 * Wavelength (the grating equation) : 
    offset = 239532.38
    stepSize = 2.4237772022101214E-6 [rad]
    d = 277.77777777777777 [nm]
    phiGInRads = 0.08503244115716374 [rad]
    ang1 = (offset - gratingPosition) * stepSize
    wavelength = 2 * d * sin(ang1) * cos(phiGInRads / 2.0) [nm]
 
 * counts/second/area : 
    integrationTime -> convert to seconds from milli-seconds
    count_rate = counts / integrationTime [counts / sec / nm] (the per nm is from the sampling at the specific grating position)
    #
    # The sensitivity of the detector changes with temperature and a small correction is needed.  This is a correction
    # to the count_rate as it deviates from the nominal temperaturee of 20.0C at the time of the measurement.
    # 
    detectorTemperatureCorr = 0.0061628
    count_rate_corr = count_rate * (1.0 + detectorTemperatureCorr * (20.0 - detectorTemp))
    dark_count_rate = dark_counts / dark_integrationTime 
    median_dark_count_rate = median(dark_count_rate * ( 1.0 + detectorTemperatureCorr * ( 20.0 - detectorTemp)))
    aperture_Area = .01 / (1E2 * 1E2) [m^2] (aperature area)
    photonsPerSecondPerM2 = (count_rate_corr - median_dark_count_rate) / aperture_Area  [photons/sec/m^2/nm] 
    
 * watts/meter^2/nm
    wavelengthInMeters -> convert to meters from nm
    h = 6.62606957E-34 [J*s]
    c = 299792458.0 [m/s]
    energyPerPhoton = h * c / wavelengthInMeters [J]
    wattsPerM2 = photonsPerSecondPerM2 * energyPerPhoton [watts/m^2/nm]
 
 * It is typical to provide the Solar Irradiances as it would be measured from a standard distance from the SUN
   (remember these are Watts/nm per meter^2 of surface area).  The standard distance is the average distance between 
   the Earth and the SUN over a full orbit (1 year) known as one Astronomical Unit (AU).
 
    wattsPerM2_1AU = wattsPerM2 / sunObserverDistanceCorrection   [watts/m^2/nm]
 
***** Files
All files are comma separated with a one line header.

  * detectorTemp.txt : in degrees Celsius. It is roughly sampled at 1 second.
  * distanceAndDoppler.txt : These are the corrections used to adjust for the changing
    distance and velocity of the spacecraft relative to the sun.
  * instrumentTelemetry.txt : Includes grating position and measured detector counts. The detector counts correspond 
    to the number of photons detected within the currently set integrationTime (in milli-seconds).     
  * integrationTime.txt : This is the currently set integration time (mlli-seconds) of the instrument. These are sampled 
    at a different cadence than the instrumentTelemetry. Assume the value is constant until there is a new value.
  * plans.txt : This file includes the experiment names with start/end times. You can find the 
    time ranges of the plans of interest here. [startTime, endTime]
  * referenceSpectrum.txt : This is a reference spectrum with accurate wavelengths. The current
    irradiance measurements will be within 15% of this spectrum.
 
***** Notes

The ConstantWavelength experiment has the grating fixed in one position mesuring the same wavelength
the whole time.  Any changes in the measured counts can be attributed to changes in the detector temperature.
The temperature correction is typically measured as a fractional change in count_rate per degree from a reference
temperature (20.0C)

corrected_rate = count_rate * (1 + corrFactor * (referenceTemp - detectorTemp))

where corrFactor = 0.0061628

Although small (~0.6%/C), this correction should be applied to both the count_rate and dark_count_rate before 
calculating the photonsPerSecondPerM2
